# Project Proposal LaTeX Template

This folder contains the following files:
* *template.tex*: this file contains the LaTeX template and should be used for generating your Project Proposal submission. You can import this file into Overleaf if you want to use it.
* *capstone.cls*: the class file for the template, simplifies the title page.
* *unnumberedtotoc.sty*: the style for the table of contents.
* *_build.cmd*: a build script for compiling the template on a Windows system. This assumes that you have miktex installed.
* *readme.md*: this file.

There are also the following image files:
* *ecse-decal-title.png*: the image for the title page. This image is required in your reports (and does not count towards the page limit.)
* *sample_diagram.png*: an example diagram to demonstrate how to include an image in the report.

## Instructions:

Do not include any identifying details for your team in the proposal: this report is supposed to be anonymous.

Modify the \titlepage{} tag to include the year number (yes, we reuse this template every year).
